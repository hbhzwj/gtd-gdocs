# Great Task Document
This project turns google docs to a full-fledge task management system.

With this google app script, you can turn any google doc to a GTD
system. If the current document is a normal document, it will add an
**Initialize** option to the menu.
If you click this option, it will change the background and margin of
the page, and create a table with four columns. The first column stores
all the "Actionable" tasks, the second column stores all the "Waiting
For" tasks, the third column stores all the "Done" tasks, and the fourth
columns stores the "Someday" tasks that have low priority.

If the document has been initialized before, it will add the following
options to the menu bar:

1. **Insert task**. You need to put your cursor in the line whose text
   should be the text description. After that, you could create task by
   clicking this menu. By default, a new task is "Actionable".
2. **Insert update**. You can put any information (update) related to a
   task. The upper part of the update display your user id and the
   timestamp you create this update, and you can write your update in
   the lower part.
3. **Mark task as**. You can change task status to be 'Actionable',
   'Waiting For', 'Done' or 'Someday'.
4. **Insert task separator**. This is to insert a separator so that
   different tasks can be separated more visually. Of course, you don't
   have to insert separator between two tasks.

Another useful trick is that when you document becomes very long, you
can press Ctrl+f and then input the timestamp to switch conveniently
between the task table and the context of the task.

##Get Things Done
The tool is motivated by [Get Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/),
which is a task-management method that help you improve your efficiency,
particularly when you need to handle multiple projects at the same time.

The idea of GTD is to store all your tasks in some external tools rather than you brain.
Each task is associated with a label that can be either "Actionable", "Waiting For", or
"Done". If a incoming task can be handled within 2 minutes, it will not be added to the
GTD system. Otherwise, if will be push to the "Actionable" queue. Whenever you need to
do something, you just pull the first task in the "Actionable" queue, finish it until
either it is done, for which case you put it to "Done" queue", or you have to waiting
for something, for which case you put it to "Waiting For" queue. You can also mark tasks
as "Someday" if you don't have bandwidth and the task is low-priority. Later when you have
time, you can move it back to "Actionable".

The following figure illustrated the process

With GTD, you will be able to focus on what you can do and do it "worry-free".
